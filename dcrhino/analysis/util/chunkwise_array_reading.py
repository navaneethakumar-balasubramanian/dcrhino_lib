    """
    Reads a partial array (contiguous chunk along the first
    axis) from an NPY file.

    Parameters
    ----------
    filename : str
        Name/path of the file from which to read.
    start_row : int
        The first row of the chunk you wish to read. Must be
        less than the number of rows (elements along the first
        axis) in the file.
    num_rows : int
        The number of rows you wish to read. The total of
        `start_row + num_rows` must be less than the number of
        rows (elements along the first axis) in the file.

    Returns
    -------
    out : ndarray

    Reads a partial array (contiguous chunk along the first
    axis) from an NPY file (not using `numpy.lib.format` functions,
    for demonstration purposes).

    Parameters
    ----------
    filename : str

    Notes
    -----
    WARNING: This function calls eval() on a data loaded from
    disk and thus should NOT be considered secure. Only load
    NPY files you trust, or replace the call to eval() with a
    suitable safe parsing function (the three properties, 'descr',
    'fortran_order' and 'shape' always come in alphabetical order
    which should make it easier).
